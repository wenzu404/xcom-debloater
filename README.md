# X.com Debloater

**X.com Debloater** is a userscript for Tampermonkey (or Greasemonkey) that streamlines your experience on X.com (formerly Twitter).  
It removes upsells, suggestions, promoted tweets, unnecessary tabs, and other clutter to give you a cleaner, more focused feed.

# Features

- Hide Premium upsells (Super Follows, Premium ads, etc.)
- Remove the "Who to follow" and "Suggestions" sidebars
- Hide the "Verified Organizations" tab
- Delete promoted tweets from the timeline
- Clean up empty wrappers and useless containers
- Remove footer links and legal sections

# Installation

To use this script, you will need a userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

1. Install Tampermonkey on your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
2. [Click here to install the script](https://github.com/wenzu404/xcom-debloater/raw/main/xcom-debloater.user.js).
   Tampermonkey should automatically detect it and open the install page.
3. If that doesn't work:
   - Copy this link: `https://github.com/wenzu404/xcom-debloater/raw/main/xcom-debloater.user.js`
   - Open Tampermonkey dashboard → **Utilities** tab → **Import from URL** → paste the link → click **Install**.

Once installed, refresh X.com — the clutter should be gone.

# Requirements

- A modern browser with Tampermonkey (or a compatible userscript manager) installed.
